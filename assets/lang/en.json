  "whatisdrugs": "What is drugaddiction",
  "whatpar": " Addiction is a chronic condition defined by compulsive or difficult-to-control substance seeking and use, despite adverse effects. Most people make the decision to use drugs voluntarily at first, but chronic drug use can cause brain changes that test an addict's self-control and make it difficult to resist strong drug cravings. These brain alterations can last a long time, which is why drug addiction is referred to as a relapsing disease: people in recovery from drug use disorders are more likely to relapse after years of abstinence.",
  "whyquestion": "Why do people get addicted to drugs?",
  "whypar": "There is no single element that can indicate whether or not a person would get addicted to drugs. Addiction risk is influenced by a number of factors. The more risk factors a person possesses, the more likely he or she is to get addicted to narcotics. Some of these factors include: Genetics: If someone in your family has previously been addicted to drugs or alcohol, it does not necessarily guarantee that you will become hooked as well. Nonetheless, because a member of your family was an addict, you will be more likely to get addicted if you take drugs.Mental Illness: For a variety of reasons, people with mental problems are more likely to use and abuse drugs. It's likely that narcotics provide people with a feeling of exhilaration and well-being. Furthermore, mental diseases will affect the same regions of the brain as drugs, thereby raising the risk of abuse. Environment: Family and friends, as well as economic position and general quality of life, all have an impact on a person's environment. Peer pressure, physical and sexual abuse, early drug exposure, stress, and parental supervision can all have a significant impact on a person's chance of drug use and addiction.",

It's also possible that they have bloodshot eyes.Sudden weight loss: Cocaine, ecstasy, or methamphetamine addicts may lose their appetite and, as a result, lose weight quickly. Insomnia (difficulty sleeping at night) and hypersomnia (difficulty sleeping during the day) are common indicators of substance misuse (sleeping for too long).Acne, paleness, and jaundice can occur as a result of long-term medication use. Scabs, scars, bruises, and track marks may also be present on the body. Personal hygiene issues: Bathing, brushing teeth, and maintaining physical cleanliness may suffer in drug addicts.",
  "changes": "Changes in behavior",
  "behaviortxt": "A person who abuses alcohol or drugs may exhibit abnormal behavior in addition to bodily abnormalities. The following are some of the most common indicators of drug misuse in adults: Secretive behavior: The individual withdraws from friends and family and is always on the lookout for a private location to consume drugs. Ignoring duties is one of the most common mistakes people make. Addiction to drugs or alcohol can cause a person to disregard daily duties such as job, school, or household maintenance. Financial distress: Because most illicit substances are quite expensive, a drug user may need to borrow money on a regular basis. They could also sell their possessions to raise funds for drugs.",

  "preventionpar": "Dealing with peer pressure in an effective manner. Teens are more likely to experiment with illegal drugs as a result of peer pressure. Nobody loves to be left out, therefore teenagers (and yes, some adults) will do things they wouldn't ordinarily do just to fit in. In these situations, you'll either need to locate a better set of friends who won't pressure you into doing bad things, or you'll need to figure out how to say no effectively. \n\n Dealing with the pressures of life. People today are overworked and overburdened, and they frequently believe that a well-deserved vacation or reward is due. Drugs, on the other hand, make life more stressful in the long run, and many of us fail to perceive this in the moment. Find alternate ways to deal with stress and unwind instead of taking drugs as a reward. Get some exercise, read a good book, volunteer with the less fortunate, or make something. Anything good and calming diverts attention away from the use of drugs to alleviate stress. \n\n Seek help if you're suffering from a mental ailment. \nMental illness and substance abuse frequently coexist. \nThose suffering from a mental condition may turn to medications to alleviate their suffering. Those suffering from mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder should seek therapy from a skilled expert before turning to drugs or alcohol.\n\n Examine each and every potential risk factor. You're more likely to overcome biological, environmental, and physical risk factors if you're aware of them.\nRisk factors include a family history of substance misuse, living in a social environment that promotes drug abuse, and/or having a family that models drug usage.\n\n Maintain a healthy lifestyle.\nWhen something in their lives isn't working, or they're unhappy with their lives or where they're headed, many turn to narcotics. Look at the big picture of life and make sure your priorities are in order. \n\n ",
